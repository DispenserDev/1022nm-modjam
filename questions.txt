1. Following the surrender of Equestria to the Changeling Lands, an unprecedented number of refugees have crossed over to shelter in our ports. However, their sheer volume has started becoming a problem for Sunset and Victoria's governors. What are your plans to alleviate this crisis-to-be?

-  Let some of them stay, we need to work with our neighbors to help with the burden. All of them can't come here.
Feedback: By your willingness to still take in a fair number of refugees, you manage to work out deals with Aquielia, Aris, and Sicameon to open their doors to the Equestrian expats as well. This is a huge PR win for your administration (despite the continued grumblings of the nationalists), and softens the potentially debilitating impact of the refugee crisis.

- It would be unheard of to send them away, not in a time like this. Let them all come; the governors can deal with it alone.
Feedback: ï»¿The refugees are incredibly thankful for the hospitality you've extended them. The denizens and governments of Sunset and Celestia, however, are not. Mostly negative press coverage of the refugee crisis shakes public faith in your administration and leaves this move a negative one with all but the most diehard supporters of the magic of friendship.

- Unfortunately, it would be too much of a strain for us to let them come. Let's just make agreements with some of our neighbors to see if they can stay there instead.
Feedback: The governors are thankful, but many of your fellow harmonists are appalled at your willingness to turn away those who need your help the most. This problem is compounded when most neighboring nations don't want to deal with your problems for you, and in the end, you can only work out a deal with the Arisians. At least the nationalists are denouncing you in slightly less harsh terms now...


2. Despite a veto you signed just last year, Congress has overridden it and passed the Public Works Act of 1021, which outlined a major sum of the government's budget to renovate the country's infrastructure sector. A caveat your party has slid into this new version of the bill however lets you outline how the funds will be allocated. How would you go ahead with the law?

- Fund projects in our rural regions, our party's foothold in the area has started to slip in recent years and we need to rebuild our support there.
Feedback: This of course, has the intended effect of increasing your hold on the rural vote- though the less glamorous nature of the projects means it does little else. Overall a safe decision, though some of your advisors worry you're playing it too safe.

- New Manehattan and Sunset City. If we must pass this law, we will surely use it where it will be most visible. Besides, the Bay Bridge could use some refurbishing.
Feedback: The urban centers of New Mareland certainly appreciate the help. You get good press coverage for the big, flashy new projects and rennovations (Your smile at the reopening of the bay bridge even makes it to the front page of the papers), albiet not without causing some of your rural base to feel betrayed.

- You know I've met a nice stallion back in my days in Equestria. He once had a suggestion for a policy similar to this. Put the funds in a lockbox and let the states pull from it when they want. But the federal government is not allowed to meddle with it.
Feedback: It's a compromise, through and through. You avoid alienating either the rural or urban wings of your party, and get applauded by small-government advocates. The tradeoff is that the local nature of the allocations means you get minimal credit for the projects the funds do go towards.


3. Newsflash from New Hoofington: It what appears to be a stunt to gain support for his party's upcoming primary election, Governor Picket Fence has personally blocked the entry of three griffon students to their classrooms in the University of Hoofington. The situation could quickly turn ugly, what should the plan be?

- If he wants to bluff then we'll play into it. Mobilize Hoofington's Joint Police and let them escort the griffons. 
Feedback: After a tense minute of the Governor staring at the Joint Police Chief, he eventually stepped aside to let the griffons pass. Even better, the public nature of Fence caving has more than shut down his primary run.

- If he wants to bluff then we'll play into it. Mobilize Hoofington's Joint Police and let them escort the griffons.
Feedback: A group of Fence's supporters must've caught wind of the mobilization, and stood next to him when the police arrived. An altercation suddenly broke out between the supporters and the police, which got everyone's attention. The griffons didn't go to school that day, and Fence's got the attention he wanted.

- If he wants to bluff then we'll play into it, but we must be precise. Send the Attorney-General, see if they make something of this.
Feedback: The Attorney General and the Governor talked for a few hours, and the entire situation cools off. But Fence still gains infamy for his stunt.

- Making a fuss about it will only put him into the spotlight, let him have his local moment. The griffons can join class some time later.
Feedback: Fence's local moment doesn't stay local for long, and news outlest across the country report on his actions, and your inaction to prevent it.


4. The ballot for party nomination has finally arrived, and while you winning is more than a formality at this point, the increasingly more powerful leftist bloc in the party is planning to vote to nominate the current Minister of Culture, Dipstick instead. The votes are yet to be cast, so the loss of support can still be mitigated. How do you plan on preventing a possible party split?

- I'm still set to speak before the convention starts, yes? I will emphasize unity first and foremost, it's in our party's name after all.
Feedback: Amazing speech, but it falls mostly on deaf ears. The votes are counted and you are nominated regardless. And the leftist wing is clearly not happy.

- I'm still set to speak before the convention starts, yes? The dissent within the party is risking our chances of a majority in the next election, we must stand firm on our promise of unity, if not the party, the nation.
Feedback: Those who listened notice a slight attack on the leftist wing, and Dipstick in particular. You've maintained your nomination by staying your course on the center, but the lack of enthusiasm for both wings of the party is palpable.

- We absolutely can't let a split happen, not when it's this early. Let me speak to Dip, maybe I can convince him to stand down, maybe adopt some of his policy ideas.
Feedback: He relents, but only after an intense round of negotiations. The party knows you have made a pivot leftwards, and they will take you up on that promise.
